It promotes loose coupling between objects by introducing a mediator object that encapsulates the communication between them. It helps to reduce dependencies between objects and simplifies their interactions.
It facilitate communication between components.
In a Mediator pattern, objects don't communicate directly with each other but instead communicate through the mediator. The mediator handles the communication and coordination between the objects. This promotes better maintainability and flexibility in a system.

In a way, the Mediator pattern can be seen as a simplified version of a message broker. It acts as an intermediary between objects, allowing them to communicate without direct dependencies on each other.

In the Mediator pattern, objects send messages through the mediator. The mediator determines how to route and deliver those messages to the appropriate recipients.

By using a mediator, objects can communicate indirectly and decouple themselves from each other, promoting better maintainability and flexibility in the system.
The mediator encapsulates the communication logic, allowing objects to focus on their own responsibilities rather than managing direct communication with other objects.
