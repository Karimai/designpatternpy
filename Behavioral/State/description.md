It is the story of state and transition which is known as state machine.

Three main concepts should be defined:
1. State:
   Defines some status for the state.
2. Triggers:
   Define some actions. What we can do in each state.
3. Rules:
   What triggers can be chosen and which state will be the result of such a trigger.
