"""
You are given a class called Person.
The person has two attributes: id and name.

Please implement a PersonFactory that has a non-static create_person() method
that takes a person's name and return a person initialized with this name and
an id.

The id of the person should be set as a 0-based index of the object created.
So, the first person the factory makes should have Id=0, second Id=1 and so on.
