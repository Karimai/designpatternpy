Building a house using the builder design pattern. We have a House object with various attributes like walls, roof, doors, windows, etc. The steps to build a house are as follows:

1. The foundation is laid.

2. The walls are built.

3. The roof is constructed.

4. The doors and windows are installed.

5. The finishing touches are added.

The Director would control the building process by calling the appropriate builder methods in the correct order. The Abstract Builder would define the interface for creating the different parts of the house, like the walls, roof, doors, and windows. The Concrete Builder would provide the implementation for these methods and create the different parts of the house.

Finally, the Product would be the completed house, with all the necessary components assembled and ready for use.
