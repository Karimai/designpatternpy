The builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create complex objects step by step.

The idea behind this pattern is to separate the construction of an object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations.

It is useful when you want to create an object that requires multiple steps or different configurations.

The Builder pattern is used to build a complex object step by step and return the final object when the building process is completed.

The pattern consists of four main components:

1. Director: This is responsible for defining the steps needed to build the object. It controls the order in which the builder methods are called and creates the final object.

2. Abstract Builder: This defines the interface for creating the parts of the complex object.

3. Concrete Builder: This provides an implementation of the Abstract Builder interface. It creates and assembles the parts of the complex object according to the builder interface.

4. Product: This is the final object that is built by the builder. It represents the complex object that is created.




Please also review my example below. 
1. Is it good or not? 
2. can you improve it a bit?
3. Can you write another example or a use case even for builder design pattern in python ?
