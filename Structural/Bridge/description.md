The main goal is **to decouple abstraction from implementation** . This pattern is useful when you want to create a set of orthogonal (means "independent" or "unrelated") classes where each class has its own independent functionality, and it is possible to mix and match any implementation with any abstraction.

It allows the client to work with different implementations of an abstraction without knowing the implementation details.

Use when you want to separate a solution where the abstraction and implementation may be tightly coupled, and you want to break it up into smaller conceptual parts.

When there is a bridge abstraction, it is possible to extend each side separately without breaking the other.

It is the story of connecting components together via abstractions.

A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).

Both Bridge and Adapter patterns are design patterns in OOP that are used to connect two interfaces, but they have some key differences:
1. Purposes: 
   1. The Bridge pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is used to separate a class's interface from its implementation, and to enable to independent hierarchies to work together.
   2. The Adapter design pattern is used to allow two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping the interface of one class to match the interface of another.
2. Relationship:
   1. In the Bridge pattern, the abstraction and implementation are connected through composition, meaning that the abstraction contains an instance of the implementation.
   2. The Adapter pattern uses object composition to adapt one interface to another, meaning that the adapter contains an instance of the adapter.
3. Abstraction Level:
   1. The Bridge pattern is used at a higher level of abstraction than the Adapter pattern.
   2. The Bridge pattern is typically used to define the overall structure of a system.
   3. The Adapter pattern is used to connect individual components.
4. Compexity:
   1. The Bridge pattern is more complex than Adapter. It involves creating two hierarchies, one for abstraction and once for implementation, and then connecting them through a bridge.
   2. The Adapter pattern involves simply creating an adapter that converts the interface of one class to another.
5. Use cases:
   1. The Bridge pattern is often used when there is a need for multiple, related variations of an object, while the Adapter pattern is used when an existing class needs to be reused, but its interface is not compatible with the rest of the system.

In summary, both the Bridge and the Adapter patterns are used to connect two interfaces, but the Bridge pattern is used to decouple and abstraction from its implementation, while the Adapter pattern is used to adapt the interface of another. The Bridge pattern is more complex and used at a higher level of abstraction, while the Adapter pattern is simpler and used to connect individual components.
