A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.

It allows you to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single instance of an object.

It composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. So, it lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

It is useful for hierarchical management.

Composite let us make compound object.

The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. In this pattern, a component is defined as an object that can have children, and a leaf is defined as an object that cannot have children. The composite pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
